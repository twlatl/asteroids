# Asteroids Game - Project Summary

## Overview
A complete implementation of the classic Asteroids arcade game in Ruby using the Gosu graphics library. This faithful recreation includes all the core gameplay mechanics from the original 1979 Atari game.

## Features Implemented

### Core Gameplay
- ✅ Spaceship with realistic physics (momentum, thrust, rotation)
- ✅ Asteroid field with 3 sizes (large → 2 medium → 1 small)
- ✅ Screen wrapping for all objects
- ✅ Collision detection
- ✅ Shooting mechanics
- ✅ Lives system (3 lives)
- ✅ Score system
- ✅ Level progression

### Advanced Features
- ✅ Alien ships that appear every 60 seconds
- ✅ AI targeting for alien ships
- ✅ Particle explosion effects
- ✅ Invulnerability period after ship destruction
- ✅ Pause functionality
- ✅ Game over and restart mechanics
- ✅ Vector-style graphics rendering
- ✅ Random asteroid shapes and movement

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Ship movement (left/right rotate, up thrust)
- **Spacebar**: Shoot bullets
- **P**: Pause/unpause
- **Escape**: Quit game

### Visual Effects
- Vector-style line graphics (authentic to original)
- Thrust flame animation
- Explosion particle effects
- Ship invulnerability blinking
- Screen wrapping for seamless movement

## Technical Implementation

### Game Engine
- Built with **Gosu** graphics library
- 60 FPS game loop
- Object-oriented design with separate classes for each game entity
- Physics simulation with velocity, momentum, and friction
- Efficient collision detection using distance calculations

### Game Mechanics
- **Asteroid Splitting**: Large → 2 Medium → 1 Small → Destroyed
- **Screen Wrapping**: All objects wrap around screen edges
- **Alien AI**: Appears every 60 seconds, shoots at player with slight inaccuracy
- **Scoring**: 20/50/100 points for large/medium/small asteroids, 1000 for aliens
- **Progressive Difficulty**: More asteroids each level

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 2.7+ installed
- Bundler gem

### Installation & Launch
```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Run the game
ruby main.rb

# Or use the launch script
./start_game.sh
```

### Testing
```bash
# Test basic components
ruby test_components.rb
```

## Code Quality
- Well-structured object-oriented design
- Separated concerns (each class handles one type of game object)
- Clear method names and documentation
- Error handling and edge cases covered
- Modular design for easy expansion

This implementation provides a complete, playable Asteroids game that faithfully recreates the original gameplay experience with modern Ruby code practices.
